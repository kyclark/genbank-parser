Revision history for Bio-GenBankParser

0.01    2008-01-23
        First version released.

0.02    2008-01-28
        Fixed up Build.PL to try to avoid automated testing errors, added
        docs, expanded example script a bit, allowed a RefSeq accession to 
        be valid in the parser.

0.03    2008-03-06
        Added project line, fixed base summary.

0.04    2008-06-20
        Changed locus name, not necessarily a genbank accession. Handle
        empty records, genbank division in LOCUS is now optional, added
        ability to comment out a line using a leading "#," genbank
        accession is now just /\w+/, sequence length can be "aa" or
        "bp," take the first accession from ACCESSION and put the rest
        into VERSION, added DBSOURCE, authors is optional in reference
        and remarks can appear in two places(?!), finally fixed handling
        of PUBMED (?), added "CONSRTM."  Keep remark undef to maintain
        backward-compat.

0.05    2010-06-22
        Added CONTIG parser.  Fixed "ACCESSION" to parse multiple lines.
